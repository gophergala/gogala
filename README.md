### Concept

  + An online Go editor that let's you code with friends.

  + Uses WebSockets and the [Go Playground](http://play.golang.org) serivce.

  + Let's you save your code as a [Gist](https://gist.github.com).

  *Isn't that just like the [Go playground](http://play.golang.org)?*

  + Maybe...


### Notes

  + The code-style is probably bad, I'm open to critics if that can improve my Go skills.

  + No tests ...didn't have time

  + An online version of this app is available [here](http://gogala.herokuapp.com) ...

    - *Don't use HTTPS*
